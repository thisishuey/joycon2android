# Joy-Con 2 BLE protocol

What the app speaks to the controllers, and the Android BLE behaviour it has to work around.

Values come from the confirmed-working macOS implementation,
[Joycon2forMac](https://github.com/seitanmen/Joycon2forMac)'s `Joycon2BLEReceiver.mm`. Where this
disagrees with community READMEs, trust this file.

## Identifiers

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Manufacturer ID (advertising) | `0x0553` (Nintendo) |
| Input service | `ab7de9be-89fe-49ad-828f-118f09df7fd0` |
| Notify characteristic (input packets) | `ab7de9be-89fe-49ad-828f-118f09df7fd2` |
| Write characteristic (commands) | `649d4ac9-8eb7-4e6c-af44-1ea54fe5f005` |
| CCCD descriptor | `0x2902` |

The write characteristic is **write without response**. Writing to the similar-looking `...fdf`
enables a subscription that never delivers data.

## Advertising

Manufacturer data for ID `0x0553` carries:

- **Bytes `[5..6]`** — little-endian product ID: `0x2067` left Joy-Con 2, `0x2066` right Joy-Con 2,
  `0x2069` Switch 2 Pro Controller, `0x2073` NSO GameCube controller. The advertisement has no local
  name, so this is the only type signal before input starts. Left, right and GameCube are confirmed
  on hardware; the Pro value is community reverse-engineering. `JoyconAdvertisement.model` maps it to
  a `ControllerModel`; the GameCube controller is held and decoded as a Pro Controller.
- **Bytes `[10..15]`** — the bonded host's MAC. Holding SYNC zeroes it; a button press on a synced
  controller wakes it into a short reconnect advertisement carrying the address. The scanner only
  accepts a zeroed field, so stray presses on nearby synced Joy-Cons don't flash into the list.

```
pairing:  01 00 03 7E 05 66 20 00 01 00 [00 00 00 00 00 00] 0F ...
wake:     01 00 03 7E 05 66 20 00 01 00 [09 A7 9A 55 E2 98] 0F ...   <- host MAC
```

### Why SYNC is needed every time

A button press only reconnects to the host the controller stored, and Android can't connect as that
host. Measured on genuine Joy-Con 2s (left and right) with an AYN Thor, Android 13, 2026-09-29:

- **The controller accepts the phone as its host.** The [console pairing
  handshake](#console-pairing-handshake) stores it, and the wake advertisement then carries the
  phone's address.
- **It still ignores the phone's connection.** Android starts LE connections from a resolvable
  private address, not the stored one. The controller never answers, and the link drops with `0x3E`
  (GATT status 62), the same as a Joy-Con stored to another host.
- **Android won't connect from its public address.** Setting `bluetooth.core.gap.le.privacy.enabled`
  to `false` from the shell is accepted but ignored on the Thor. A Galaxy S25 (Android 16) refuses it.
- Standard SMP bonding is rejected (drops the link, status 22). Whether a public-address connection
  would also need link-layer encryption with the LTK is untested.

#### Console pairing handshake

This is how a Switch 2 stores itself on the controller. Commands go to the side-specific command
characteristic (`ce49a830-dced-48ae-931e-c8cf88aadbea` left, `65a724b3-f1e7-4a61-8078-a342376b27ff`
right, write without response) as `id 91 01 sub 00 len 00 00` + data, behind 17 zero bytes, after
writing `01 00` to `00c5af5d-1964-4e30-8f51-1956f96bd282`. Replies notify on
`c765a961-d9d8-4d36-a20a-5315b111836a`, echoing `id` and `sub`.

1. `15/01`: `00 02`, the host address byte-reversed, then the same address with its lowest byte
   minus one.
2. `15/04`: `00` + A1 (any 16 bytes). The reply data is a status byte + B1. The LTK is `A1 xor B1`.
3. `15/02`: `00` + A2 (any 16 bytes). The reply is `AES-128-ECB(key = reversed LTK, block = reversed
   A2)`, which proves the key.
4. `15/03` `00`, then `03/07` with the second address + the reversed LTK, then `03/09` to store it.

A lone `15/01` doesn't change the stored host. Pairing replaces the console's entry: SYNC on the
Switch 2 restores it.

## Connection sequence

```
connectGatt(TRANSPORT_LE)
 └ onConnectionStateChange(CONNECTED)
     └ requestMtu(247)
         └ onMtuChanged
             └ discoverServices()
                 └ onServicesDiscovered
                     ├ find write char 649D4AC9..., notify char ...FD2
                     ├ enqueue: write CCCD(...FD2) = ENABLE_NOTIFICATION
                     ├ enqueue: write cmd1 to 649D4AC9... (NO_RESPONSE)
                     └ enqueue: write cmd2 to 649D4AC9... (NO_RESPONSE)
 └ onCharacteristicChanged(...FD2) → parse 63 bytes → emit input
```

Init commands, 12 bytes each, written without response 500 ms apart:

```
Command 1 (buttons/standard):  0C 91 01 02 00 04 00 00 FF 00 00 00
Command 2 (IMU/extended):      0C 91 01 04 00 04 00 00 FF 00 00 00
```

## Packet layout

63 bytes, little-endian. Each controller is its own BLE peripheral with its own notification
stream.

| Field | Offset | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PacketID | 0x00 | uint24 | sequence counter; in practice a millisecond clock |
| Buttons | 0x03 | uint32 | bitmap, below |
| Back paddles | 0x07 | uint8 | Pro Controller only, below |
| Left Stick | 0x0A | 3 bytes | 12-bit X = `val & 0xFFF`, Y = `(val >> 12) & 0xFFF` |
| Right Stick | 0x0D | 3 bytes | same packing |
| Mouse X/Y | 0x10–0x13 | int16 ×2 | |
| Mouse Unk | 0x14 | int16 | |
| Mouse Distance | 0x16 | int16 | |
| Mag X/Y/Z | 0x18–0x1D | int16 ×3 | |
| Battery Voltage | 0x1F | uint16 | volts = raw / 1000 |
| Battery Current | 0x28 | int16 | mA = raw / 100 |
| Temperature | 0x2E | int16 | °C = 25 + raw / 127 |
| Accel X/Y/Z | 0x30–0x35 | int16 ×3 | 4096 = 1 g |
| Gyro X/Y/Z | 0x36–0x3B | int16 ×3 | 48000 = 360 °/s |
| Trigger L | 0x3C | uint8 | analog, GameCube controller only ([below](#analog-triggers)) |
| Trigger R | 0x3D | uint8 | analog, GameCube controller only |

A left Joy-Con's right-stick bytes are garbage, and a right Joy-Con's left-stick bytes are too.

The mask's low nibble lights P1–P4 solid (`0x01`, `0x02`, `0x04`, `0x08`), its high nibble flashes
them (`0x10` … `0x80`). `0xF0`, all flashing, is the controller's default cycling animation.

### Analog triggers

The NSO GameCube controller's L and R travel to a **first stop**, where analog travel ends, then
click through to a **second stop**, which sets the L/R button bit. Measured on three units with a
Retroid Pocket Nova, 2026-10-07:

| | Raw |
|---|---|
| Factory zero (SPI `0x013140`, byte 0 left, byte 1 right; `0xFF` unset) | 31–35 |
| Rest | factory zero −2..+4 |
| First stop | 170–196, differing by side and unit |
| Second stop, bit set | 209–242 |

- **The click is the bit, never an analog threshold.** In quick presses the bit can show with the
  analog value at 155, and values up to 220 pass without it.
- `TriggerCalibrator` maps factory zero plus a 5-count dead zone to 0 and the first stop to 255.
  Full starts at 170 and widens to a value **held** still for 5 packets without the click, up to 205,
  so quick presses through to the click don't move it. Without a factory zero, the lowest value seen
  stands in.
- Other drivers (Linux, SDL, BlueRetro) scale to ~225–232, the click point, which caps an unclicked
  trigger at ~80%.

## SPI reads

The controller keeps its factory data in SPI flash. `FactoryCalibrationReads` picks what a model
needs at connect:

| Field | Address | Length | Read for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main stick calibration | `0x0130A8` | 9 | the GameCube controller (its main stick) |
| Right stick calibration | `0x0130E8` | 9 | the GameCube controller (its C-stick) |
| [Trigger zeros](#analog-triggers) | `0x013140` | 2 | the GameCube controller |
| Shell accent colour | `0x01301F` | 3 | every model, inside the DeviceInfo read below |

**Stick calibration** is three X/Y pairs, each packed in 3 bytes as two 12-bit values (X = `b0 |
(b1 & 0x0F) << 8`, Y = `b1 >> 4 | b2 << 4`): the centre, the span above it, the span below it. All
`FF` means unset. Layout and addresses are from the Linux `hid-nintendo` Switch 2 driver (v16) and
SDL's `SDL_hidapi_switch2.c`, both USB; the same flash serves BLE. A user calibration made on a
Switch 2 lives at `0x1FC040` (magic `B2 A1`, then the same 9 bytes); the app doesn't read it, and
sources disagree on the right stick's address. Only the GameCube controller's values have been
checked against its sticks, so Joy-Con 2 and Pro Controllers aren't read and learn theirs instead.

The **shell accent colour** is the per-side colour (coral right, blue left) the UI paints each
controller with. Not the body colour at `0x013019`: that is the near-black shell, the same on both
Joy-Cons.

The request reads the surrounding DeviceInfo block, `0x40` bytes from `0x013000`:

```
02 91 00 04 00 08 00 00  40 7E 00 00  00 30 01 00
report cmd               len magic    address, LE
```

Byte 2 must be `0x00`, as HandHeldLegend's procon2tool sends it. The init commands carry `0x01`
there, but an SPI read with `0x01` gets no reply.

The reply arrives on the command-response characteristic. Layout, little-endian, confirmed on a live
controller:

| Offset | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | report type — `0x02` for SPI |
| `3` | command — `0x04` for SPI read |
| `8` | data length |
| `12..15` | source address, echoing the address requested |
| `16..` | data bytes, starting at that source address |

`SpiColorParser` finds the field at `16 + (wanted address − echoed address)`, so the block can be
requested at any alignment.

## Battery

The packet's voltage reads ~0.6 V below the cell's: ~3.30 V shows 75% on a Switch 2, ~3.60 V shows
100%. `BatteryGauge` interpolates Nintendo's Joy-Con thresholds (3.3 / 3.6 / 3.76 / 3.9 / 4.2 V,
from dekuNukem's docs) shifted down 0.6 V. Below ~3.0 V is extrapolated; no low readings have been
captured yet.

## Stick range and centre

The raw 12-bit sticks neither span `0x000..0xFFF` nor rest at the midpoint, and both vary per
controller and per axis. Measured:

```
travel:  full left ~900   full right ~3400   full down ~890   full up ~3360   (half-span ~1250)
rest:    left Joy-Con  x 2080  y 2157        right Joy-Con  x 2014  y 2022
```

Rest isn't the midpoint of travel (those extremes midpoint to 2150/2125), so it has to be sampled.
Treating 2048 as centre and half-span leaves full deflection at ~60% with a 4–5% drift at rest.

`StickCalibrator` runs where packets are parsed, so the live display, gamepad and DSU all see
corrected values:

- **A GameCube controller's factory calibration wins** once its [flash read](#spi-reads) answers,
  about a second after connecting: it sets the centre and each direction's span. Everything below is
  how every other controller calibrates, and the GameCube controller's fallback for unset flash and
  the first packets before the reply.
- **Centre** is learned from the first still window (30 samples), then frozen: a stick held at full
  deflection is perfectly still too.
- **Each direction scales by its own span**, the centre/below/above triple the factory calibration
  stores. Spans are seeded just under the smallest travel measured (~1180 LSB), so full tilt works
  from the first packet, and only ever widen, factory spans included. The NSO GameCube controller's
  C-stick travels less, 1022–1204 from centre on three units (2026-10-07), so its spans are seeded
  at 1000.
- Changing a controller's type resets the calibrator; the factory values are applied again.

## Android BLE gotchas

1. **MTU first.** The default ATT MTU of 23 truncates 63-byte notifications: `requestMtu(247)`
   after connecting, wait for `onMtuChanged`, then discover services.
2. **One GATT operation at a time.** A second issued before the callback is silently dropped.
   `GattOpQueue` advances on the matching callback, or after a timeout if none comes.
3. **Write the CCCD.** `setCharacteristicNotification(true)` alone delivers nothing; descriptor
   `0x2902` must be written too.
4. **Pass `TRANSPORT_LE`** to `connectGatt`, or it may try classic Bluetooth.
5. **Connect cooldown.** Rapid repeated connects make the controller stop responding. Press SYNC to
   re-advertise, and wait if it stays unresponsive.
6. **Connection interval is the report rate.** Each report carries buttons, sticks and motion.
   Balanced priority settled on 30 ms (~33 Hz), which reads as motion stutter at 60 fps; high
   priority brought it to 15 ms (~67 Hz) (AYN Thor, 2026-09). **Faster controller updates**
   requests high priority while the virtual gamepad or DSU is on (`FasterUpdatesPolicy`), at a
   battery cost on both ends.
7. **Deprecated write APIs are deliberate.** The `.value =` pattern keeps API 24 support; the API
   33+ overloads behave the same.
